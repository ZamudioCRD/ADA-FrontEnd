    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>Show me how to lie, you're getting better all the time
      And turning all against the one is an art that's hard to teach
      Another clever word sets off an unsuspecting herd
      And as you step back into line, a mob jumps to their feet</p>
    <p>Now dance, fucker, dance, man, he never had a chance
      And no one even knew it was really only you
      And now you steal away
      Take him out today
      Nice work you did
      You're gonna go far, kid</p>
    <p>With a thousand lies and a good disguise
      Hit 'em right between the eyes
      Hit 'em right between the eyes
      When you walk away, nothing more to say
      See the lightning in your eyes
      See 'em running for their lives</p>
    <p>Slowly out of line, and drifting closer in your sight
      So play it out, I'm wide awake, it's a scene about me
      There's something in your way and now someone is gonna pay
      And if you can't get what you want, well, it's all because of me</p>
    <p>Now dance, fucker, dance, man, I never had a chance
      And no one even knew, it was really only you
      And now you'll lead the way
      Show the light of day
      Nice work you did
      You're gonna go far, kid
      Trust deceived</p>
    <p>With a thousand lies and a good disguise
      Hit 'em right between the eyes
      Hit 'em right between the eyes
      When you walk away, nothing more to say
      See the lightning in your eyes
      See 'em running for their lives</p>
    <p>Now dance, fucker, dance, he never had a chance
      And no one even knew, it was really only you
      So dance, fucker, dance, I never had a chance
      It was really only you</p>
    <p>With a thousand lies and a good disguise
      Hit 'em right between the eyes
      Hit 'em right between the eyes
      When you walk away, nothing more to say
      See the lightning in your eyes
      See 'em running for their lives
      Clever alibis, Lord of the Flies
      Hit 'em right between the eyes
      Hit 'em right between the eyes
      When you walk away, nothing more to say
      See the lightning in your eyes
      See 'em running for their lives</p>
